This is a branchout of hpc-testing. As such this is aiming at adding
some user-space HPC tests. Those might not be suitable for the hpc-testing
upstream project, so for now those tests are kept here.

Eventually this might be a separate project or - if desired and reasonable -
could be merged into hpc-testing.
